VOLUME /tmp
# NOTE: We added a VOLUME pointing to "/tmp" because that is where a Spring Boot application
# creates working directories for Tomcat by default. The effect is to create a temporary
# file on your host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the container under "/tmp".
# This step is optional for the simple app that we wrote here, but can be necessary for
# other Spring Boot applications if they need to actually write in the filesystem.

ADD /target/discovery-microservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

RUN sh -c 'touch /app.jar'
# NOTE: You can use a RUN command to "touch" the jar file so that it has a file modification
# time (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state by default).
# This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote, but any static
# content (e.g. "index.html") would require the file to have a modification time.

EXPOSE 8761


# NOTE: To reduce Tomcat startup time we added a system property pointing
# to "/dev/urandom" as a source of entropy.

# Added: "-Dspring.profiles.active=prod"
# try to add it as an external command so we can deploy all
# types of profiles
#ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-Dspring.profiles.active=prod","-jar","/app.jar"]
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app.jar"]
